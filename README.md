# Isosurface Rendering Engine
An isosurface is a function of the form ```f(r) = c```.
This project is a unity implementation of a collection of different sampling and rendering systems.
It makes heavy use of [My Symbolic Algebra System](https://github.com/Joeoc2001/AlgebraSystem)

## Supported & planned rendering systems
 - [x] Voxelization
 - [x] Marching Cubes
 - [ ] Marching Tetrahedra
 - [x] Surface Nets
 - [x] Dual Contouring
 - [ ] Manifold Dual Contouring
