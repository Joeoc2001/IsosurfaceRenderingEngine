# Isosurface Rendering Engine
An isosurface is a function of the form ```f(r) = c```.
This project is a unity implementation of both an algebra system to handle these isosurfaces, as well as a collection of different sampling and rendering systems.

## Supported & planned rendering systems
 - [x] Voxelization
 - [x] Marching Cubes
 - [ ] Marching Tetrahedra
 - [ ] Surface Nets
 - [ ] Dual Contouring
 - [ ] Manifold Dual Contouring
